# First [install](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Yk6t34D0loLvZe92zGBNbfhTebdvhx1/view?usp=sharing) the Quartus Prime Standard and/or Pro 18.1 software:

#[download all files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uDMS_Ts3kvtyWFqVMHF3S-U4zq9OGoCM)

# Step 1: Copy the [Quartus_18.1.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wdH9_gWmR0dsyN_S57goO0_KJZAX5l0f/view?usp=sharing) to C:\intelFPGA\18.1\quartus\bin64 and/or C:\intelFPGA_Pro\18.1\quartus\bin64 (your installation directory may not be the same ), That is to say put it in the same folder as quartus.exe.
          Double-click to run! This cracker will automatically identify whether the Quartus 18.1 is Standard Edition or Pro Edition, and then automatically crack.
# Step 2: download [license.dat file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e4eJQ6UB-cefMJD2qFuIqq5jMRDNvl_G/view?usp=sharing) and Replace XXXXXXXXXXXX in license.dat with your network card number (select License Setup in the Quartus Prime 18.1 Tools menu. There will be a NIC ID. Select either the first or the second).

# Step 3: Select License Setup in the Quartus Prime 18.1 Tools menu, select License file, and click OK.

# The path name stored in the license file cannot contain spaces. Spaces can be replaced with underscores.
# For most users, you don't need to crack ModelSim, you can use the free ModelSim-Altera Starter Edition, which is the entry version, you can simulate 10,000 lines of executable code
  (this 10,000 lines means not including comments, pure Code). Only a very large design requires the ModelSim-Altera Edition or the ModelSim-SE version.
  These two versions need to be cracked, and the cracker searches for it. I don't provide it.

Common FAQs:
1. Red error when compiling: Current license file does not support the xxxxxx device. This is a problem that has not been solved successfully.
   The first possibility is that the dll file has not been successfully modified. You can see if there are any signs of Cyclone since the Quartus startup. Please close the antivirus software and re-hack it again.
   The second possibility: Modify the network card number in the license file without paying attention to the format. For example, there is a space or network card number with "-" and so on after the network card number.
2. The cracker is forbidden to access dll files or dll files. This is because Quartus has not been shut down or has not been completely shut down.
   The solution is to close or kill the Quartus related processes that are still running, if you do not Will kill the process, had to restart Windows to crack again.

Remarks:
# Because this cracker software belongs to "software that modifies other software", so it may be mistaken for "virus" under certain anti-virus software. This is the reason why the anti-virus software is not intelligent enough. Close it, open it after cracking.
#Quartus Starting from 14.0, there is only a 64-bit version. This cracker has been verified under Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 64-bit operating systems, no problem! Windows XP, Vista, and 8 have been abandoned because of Microsoft, so there is no verification. In theory, 64-bit XP, Vista, and 8 may work, but try to use 64-bit Windows 7 or 8.1.
